		<h2>Job History</h2>
		<p><strong>Dishwasher at A Taste of Heaven</strong></p>
		<p>Between my Junior and Senior years of High School, I had a summer job at a local bakery called 
		A Taste of Heaven. There, I served as a dishwasher and earned $18 an hour. I had an overall positive experience working there, but had to end my 
		employment there to focus on school. </p>
		<p><strong>Computer Science Internship</strong></p>
		<p>For two weeks over the summer, I had a internship with Veritread LLC, an industrial machinery shipping company. 
		I shawdowed developer meetings and completed a web-monitoring python project. The program I created perdioically crawled through
		a given website's internal and external links and got a response code from each one. If the response code read anything other than
		200, the program would email a given email with text that read: "Link:______website link_______ has a response code of _response code__"</p>
		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<p>I learned Java through taking AP Computer Science A at my high school. I learned python in my own time with Code Academy, though I could use more
		practice. I am proficient in Math, and am currently enrolled in a Multivariable Calculus course at my school.</p>
		<h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
		<p>In college, I plan majoring in Computer Science and earning a Master's or higher in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. 
		The ultimate career goal is to advance the field of artificial intelligence either through research or creating actual user applications. One of the
		ways I've pursued this interest in AI was participating in a program called Inspirit AI. Through the two week program, I was introduced
		to the various sub-sections of AI, including Machine Learning, Neural Networks, NLP, etc. I've also been working on creating a playable chess engine
		through the help of a YouTube tutorial series. </p>
