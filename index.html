			<h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
			<p>In college, I plan majoring in Computer Science and earning a Master's or higher in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. 
			The ultimate career goal is to advance the field of artificial intelligence either through research or creating actual user applications. One of the
			ways I've pursued this interest in AI was participating in a program called Inspirit AI. Through the two week program, I was introduced
			to the various sub-sections of AI, including Machine Learning, Neural Networks, NLP, etc. I've also been working on creating a playable chess engine
			through the help of a YouTube tutorial series. </p>
