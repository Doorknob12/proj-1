    <h1 class="header">7 Reasons I Should Be Given a Kangaroo</h1>
    <section class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">1.</span> I love kangaroos</h2>
      <p>This goes without saying. If I didn't love kangaroos, then why would I create this list of 7 Reasons Why I Should be Given a Kangaroo?
        I love kangaroos because they're so funny looking. Their pouches make them look like those parents that have baby harnesses strapped
        to the front of them. The fact that they can jump and box and disembowl their prey with their razor sharp toenails makes them all the more lovable.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">2.</span> They're so cute</h2>
      <p>I personally find kangaroos to be one of the cutest mammals in the mammal kingdom (just nearly being beat out by blue whales).
        I view my desire to own a kangaroo as comparable to a person's desire to own a cute dog. Sure, dogs are domesticated and generally aren't deadly,
        but that doesn't mean I shouldn't at least be able to try and domesticate a kangaroo. How did we domesticate dogs? We befriended wolves! And wolves
        are far deadlier than kangaroos, so domesticating kangaroos is a no&#8211;brainer.

    <section class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">3.</span> I really want one</h2>
      <p>I really want one. Again, I wouldn't be listing the 7 main reasons (there are more reasons but they're more personal) that I think
        I should receive a kangaroo if I didn't want one. I know that simply wanting something doesn't warant that want to automatically be fufilled,
        but in this specific instance, I believe it does. Kangaroos are widely unwanted by people. They think that kangaroos are &#8220;dangerous&#8221; or
        &#8220;a threat to my children&#8221; or they &#8220;literally just kicked Uncle Steve like that just happened just now oh my God is he ok.&#8221; It is my opinion that kangaroos
        lash out in these ways because they don't get enough positive attention. If I want a kangaroo, and a kangaroo were given to me, and that
        kangaroo knew that I wanted it, I believe it would be as friendly as any household pet or family member.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">4.</span> Like I really want one</h2>
      <p>I cannot emphasize this enough; I really want one. You may think that this point is the same as the last, and it is, but it serves
        an important roll in conveying how much I want a kangaroo. If I just said, &#8220;Yeah, I want a kangaroo.&#8221; you might laugh at me and say
        &#8220;Surely you're not serious.&#8221; But if I said over and over that I wanted a kangaroo, you might think that I'm not right in the head, but at least
        you'd be convinced that I do, in fact, sincerly want a kangaroo.

    <section class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">5.</span> I can do a pretty good Australian accent</h2>
      <p>I anticipate that this will make communication with the animal far easier than if I had an American accent or even a mediocre English accent. 
        Communication is vital in any relationship, regardless of its nature, so my ability to effectively convey my emotions and thoughts to 
        this kangaroo through an Australian accent only proves that I am ready to embark on the wild journey that is befriending a kangaroo.

      <h2><span class="firstchar">6.</span> I think I could handle a kangaroo</h2>
      <p>If the kangaroo ever decided to get violent, I could effectively handle and subdue the beast. I am aware that kangaroos are notorious
        for conducting themselves in a menacing manner, specifically their tendancy to balance on their tails and disembowl their prey with their razor sharp
        toe nails and absurdly strong legs, but I believe I could calm the animal down enough through positive reinforcement for me to then catch it by surprise and hug it, effectively pinning its
        arms to its sides. I would then walk it over to its room and close the door with kangaroo&#8211;proof doorknobs on it on it.

      <h2><span class="firstchar">7.</span> I have a contact within the Lincoln Park Zoo who is open to negotiations</h2>
      <p>I cannot discuss the details at this point, but I am cautiously&#8211;optimistic that a deal can be reached. </p>
