    <h1 class="header">7 Reasons I Should NOT Be Given a Kangaroo</h1>
    <div class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">1.</span> I have no self control</h2>
      <p>I mean it. I have possess a zero amount of self control. Hell, yestarday I bought a $30 burger because the name listed on the menu was 
        &#8220;Burgerlicious Buns.&#8221; Important note: I'm vegan. Well, as of one week ago I'm vegan, and that's only because I joined a vegan pledge 
        drive after one of the volunteers asked me to &#8220;Pretty peas&#8221; go vegan. Again, impulse control, not my strong suit. I'm not entirely sure how this will relate to
        how well I'm able to take care of a kangaroo, but I'd expect my rash decision making to eventually put either the kangaroo, myself, or both of us in danger.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">2.</span> I am serverly irresponsible</h2>
      <p>I do not know where my housekeys are. I lost them a while back and have just been climbing through a window in the back that I keep unlocked. If I can't take care of my keys, how will I be able to take care of a kangaroo. They're like, harder to take care of than keys, is what my point is, I guess.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">3.</span> I do not know how to care for a kangaroo</h2>
      <p>I do not have the patience to research how to effectively care for a kangaroo. I am sure there are many dietary and enviornmental needs that I would have to be aware of in order to properly care for a kangaroo, but I simply would not want to put in the effort to accomidate those needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">4.</span> I do not have the resources to care for a kangaroo</h2>
      <p>The amount of space that I can currently claim as my own is about the size of large closet. The amount of money I can claim as my own
        is the amount I could earn from renting out my large closet space to my Uncle Steve. (That's just a little family joke. It's funny because
        Uncle Steve is dead.) 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">5.</span> I have two cats that likely will not like kangaroo</h2>
      <p>Their names are Jessie and Cece and they already don't like each other. I doubt that the introduction of a much larger and, quite frankly, much
        cuter animal will do much to relieve tensions. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">6.</span> I could not beat a kangaroo in a fight</h2>
      <p>Upon further research, I have come to the conclusion that I could NOT beat a kangaroo in a fight should I ever find myself in the wake of an angry
        Joey Gordon-Levitt (that's what I would name the kangaroo if I received one).
      </p>

    <div class="reason">
      <h2><span class="firstchar">7.</span> I am beginning to suspect that my contact within the Lincoln Park Zoo system is a member of the Animal Trafficking Division of the FBI</h2>
      <p>Thank goodness this entire site is encrypted. I think. </p>
