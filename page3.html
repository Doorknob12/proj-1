			<h1>7 Reasons I Should NOT Be Given a Kangaroo</h1>
			<h2>1. I have no self control</h2>
			<p>I mean it. I have possess a zero amount of self control. Hell, yestarday I bought a $30 burger because the name listed on the menu was 
			"Burgerlicious Buns." Important note: I'm vegan. Well, as of one week ago I'm vegan, and that's only because I joined a vegan pledge 
			drive after one of the volunteers asked me to "Pretty peas" go vegan. Again, impulse control, not my strong suit. I'm not entirely sure how this will relate to
			how well I'm able to take care of a kangaroo, but I'd expect my rash decision making to eventually put either the kangaroo, myself, or both of us in danger.</p>
			<h2>2. I am servely irresponsible</h2>
			<p>I do not know where my housekeys are. I lost them a while back and have just been climbing through a window in the back that I keep unlocked. If I can't take care of my keys, how will I be able to take care of a kangaroo. They're like, harder to take care of than keys, is what my point is, I guess.</p>
			<h2>3. I do not know how to care for a kangaroo</h2>
			<p>I do not have the patience to research how to effectively care for a kangaroo. I am sure there are many dietary and enviornmental needs that I would have to be aware of in order to properly care for a kangaroo, but I simply would not want to put in the effort to accomidate those needs.</p>
			<h2>4. I do not have the resources to care for a kangaroo</h2>
			<p>The amount of space that I can currently claim as my own is about the size of large closet. The amount of money I can claim as my own
			is the amount I could earn from renting out my large closet space to my Uncle Steve. (That's just a little family joke. It's funny because
			Uncle Steve is dead.) </p>
			<h2>5. I have two cats that likely will not like kangaroo</h2>
			<p>Their names are Jessie and Cece and they already don't like each other. I doubt that the introduction of a much larger and, quite frankly, much
			cuter animal will do much to relieve tensions. </p>
			<h2>6. I could not beat a kangaroo in a fight</h2>
			<p>Upon further research, I have come to the conclusion that I could NOT beat a kangaroo in a fight should I ever find myself in the wake of an angry
			Joey Gordon-Levitt (that's what I would name the kangaroo if I received one).</p>

			<h2>7. I am beginning to suspect that my contact within the Lincoln Park Zoo system is a member of the Animal Trafficking Division of the FBI</h2>
			<p>Thank goodness this entire site is encrypted. I think. </p>
